# Reffer

This is supposed to be a community based reference management solution. The idea is that people can upload their bib files which will be stored in a database. And people can also search by different fields. Of course, it is supposed to be free. In the backend, the database used is mongodb from free tier atlas. This has a 512MB limit. I do not know what happens if the limit is crossed.
